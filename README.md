# Grid-Based-Route-RePlanning
Route planning is used in the navigation of autonomous agents, e.g., self-driving vehicles, robots, and humans (think of mapping services). Grid-based route planning studies the problem of constructing a route from an initial cell to a destination cell in a two-dimensional space subdivided into grid cells that are either blocked or empty.

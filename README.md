# Grid-Based-Route-RePlanning
Route planning is used in the navigation of autonomous agents, e.g., self-driving vehicles, robots, and humans (think of mapping services). Grid-based route planning studies the problem of constructing a route from an initial cell to a destination cell in a two-dimensional space subdivided into grid cells that are either blocked or empty.

# Learning Outcomes
In this project, you will demonstrate your understanding of dynamic memory and linked data structures (Chapter 10), and extend your skills in terms of program design, testing, and debugging. You will also learn about route planning, and implement a simple route re-planning mechanism in preparation for the more principled approaches that are introduced in comp20007 Design of Algorithms.
